## Motivation
I was motivated to create Pong the way I did because I enjoy playing single player games. It was important for me to create some for of AI to control the opposing paddle for this reason. I also wanted some level randomization, so the starting position and velocities are randomly chosen. The version of pong that most inspired me was Pong for the Atari 2600. This is what pong looks like in my mind, so I decided to emulate the general layout.
